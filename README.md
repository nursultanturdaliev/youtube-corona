# YouTube Without Corona

I think, almost all of us get tired of hearing, watching, consuming the same stuff again and again. At least I did. These days I got tired of getting `Corona Virus` related videos as a recommendation on my YouTube channel... I am not against the virus, but my brain can't consume more. I need to protect my brain! It's a pity that YouTube doesn't provide these kind of features out of the box at least for premium subscribers...

Do you also want to have this kind of protection? Yes? Then let's create a greate extension which could benefit millions of users from the same shit!


This extension is kind of `Adblocker` but for specific topics on specific platforms.

5. Now you should not see any Corona related videos
